Collected Knowledge & Wisdom on
# GRAVATAR API
---
## Provides:
This API allows users to set up profiles containing both personal information, and more importantly, a profile picture. The user's information is then stored as part of a publicly available API so the data can be accessed by any 3rd party site (such as Smithy). Gravatar uses an MD5 hash to create unique hashcodes that call the "avatars" from the API.


### Pain factor: 1
(0=ezpz...5=nightmare)

### Key Provisioning:     

- No key required, however, it does require a sign in through either Gravatar or WordPress.

### Quotas:
- None mentioned.

## The Good:
- Very easy to set up and manipulate using python
- Includes options (ex. d, i) which allow for error handling
- - i.e. what picture shows if user is not registered? what size is the picture retrieved in?
- No storage required on your site's droplet
## The Bad:
- WordPress login (if that bothers you)
- The API is PUBLIC so keep in mind what you upload
## The Ugly:
- None (so it seems)
